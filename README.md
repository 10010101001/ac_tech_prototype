# AssaultCube Tech Prototype #

## Purpose ##

Development of the computer game AssaultCube began in 2004 and was first released in 2006. It is based on the [Cube (1) Engine](http://cubeengine.com/). 

The challenge: AssaultCube can no longer live up to the expectations of todays players in terms of visual appearance. 

It is safe to say that all the potential of the Cube Engine technology has been fully exploitet. It is not possible to make the game look better with this engine. The artists have done everything possible to use the available tools to the max and they achieved outstanding results given the technological limits. 

The natural step forward is to renew the technology stack from the ground up and to provide new tools to the artists so that they can produce new, modern content for the game.

The Cube Engine has meanwhile been succeeded by [Cube 2: Sauerbraten](http://sauerbraten.org/) which in turn has been succeeded by [Tesseract](http://tesseract.gg/).

The purpose of the prototype is to explore how the technology of AssaultCube could be renewed by using Tesseract.
